* Advance Resources Management

[[./screenshots/time_table.png]]

This is an early project of mine. It is an application written in java that is meant to generate a school program. Given some conditions like how many of each sujects each class in a school must have and what teachers are available for this subject, the application tries to efficiently allocate classes and teachers in time slots over the week. 

\\

I developed the program when I was in the high school and the project "secured" me a good spot in the rankings of the national competition for IT in Bulgaria. The application was targeted at bulgarian users so the UI is in bulgarian.

** Screenshots
Here are some screenshots from the application. If you are not a bulgarian, it'll probably not make any sense to you but... enjoy anyway.

** Building

The whole thing was programmed in java (8). Originally I used only [[https://netbeans.org/][Netbeans]] for the development and I had no idea what "build system" was. Recently, however, I took the time to make the project buildable with [[https://gradle.org/][gradle]]. Now, hopefully, it can be build on any system that supports some JVM and gradle for building.

\\
Simply cloning and building the target =fatJar= should do everything:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git clone https://github.com/palikar/AdvancedResouceMenaging
gradle fatJar
#+END_SRC

To run the application:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
java -jar ./build/libs/AdvancedResouceMenaging-all.jar
#+END_SRC
